# Devs Gone Wild

**Biodiversity Informatics • Open Source • Wild Ideas**

Welcome to **Devs Gone Wild** – a space for developers, data wranglers, and nature nerds who work at the intersection of biodiversity and code.

We're the team behind the **UK’s largest biodiversity data platform**, the [NBN Atlas](https://nbnatlas.org). Here, we explore what happens when you take biodiversity informatics, open data, and a love of wild systems—and build software around it.

## What You'll Find (Eventually)

### **Blog**
Write-ups on our work, architecture deep dives, thoughts on open biodiversity infrastructure, and the occasional AI-assisted rabbit hole.

### **Code Lab**
Experiments, tutorials, and code walk-throughs that:
- Build on standards like **Darwin Core**
- Interface with systems like **GBIF**, **ALA**, and the **NBN Atlas**
- Visualize and process **species occurrence data**
- Use tools like **React**, **HTMX**, **Python**, and maybe a bit of **R**
- Occasionally go a bit off-road (it’s wild out here, after all)

### **Projects**
Expect things like:
- Revived React component libraries
- API wrappers and data pipelines
- Little AI-powered tools for nature data wrangling
- Plugins or tools that extend biodiversity platforms

### **About Us**
What biodiversity informatics means to us, how we work, and why we’re building this site outside traditional org structures.

## Who's Behind This?

We're a small team of developers working in biodiversity data—originally rooted in the NBN Trust, but thinking beyond its edges.

We care about:
- Keeping tools open and alive even when projects end
- Building community among biodiversity technologists
- Creating space for volunteers, weird ideas, and clever experiments

This site is independent, but proudly aligned with the mission of the **National Biodiversity Network**.
